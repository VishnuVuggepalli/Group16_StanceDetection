Agricultural activities are responsible for a significant proportion of greenhouse gases produced by maize ethanol.

If this is true (which is clearly not true), why should they do so? If we are generous, one could say that the election claim assumes that people have no sexual orientation to the point that they choose one. And some people choose homosexuality?

Indeed, the erosion of the minimum wage has resulted in low-wage workers earning significantly less today than their counterparts 50 years ago.

Gold provides a self-correcting mechanism for irrational exuberance.

Finally, the Department of Justice does not guarantee minimum wages for drug addicts, nor does it care about working conditions in the industry. But whether or not we approve of sex work, or whether we want our daughters to be employed in such a way, the moral case for sentencing begins to unravel when we look at the conditions of abuse that real women suffer in the industry.

Dreadful predictions of future warming are based almost exclusively on computer-based climate models, but these models do not accurately understand the role or steam - and in any case, water vapour is not under our control.
