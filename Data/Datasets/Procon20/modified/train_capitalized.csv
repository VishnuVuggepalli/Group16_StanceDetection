10,"Is Solar Power an Economical Alternative to Conventional Energy? ""President Obama subsidized solar and other renewable energy iN tHe United States with taxpayer money to the tune of $39 billion per year on average for the past 5 years. These massive subsidies, however, have done little to increase the contribution of solar power to the electricity geneRation mix as solar is expected to pRoduce just 0.6 perceNt of electricity generation this year...   States also have also heavily subsidized the solar industry by offering tax breaks and 538 rebate programs. Twenty states have personal tax credits related to solar products, 18 states have corporate tax credit and deduction programs, and 14 states and PUerto Rico offer taxpayer-funded grants to support solar ElecTricity. The 538 different state and local green energy rebate programs are Intended to reduce the final cost of products including solar water heaters and grid-conNected rooftop solar panels...   Government progRams intended to drive down the cost of Solar electricity have failed to make expensive sources of energy affordable. As result, instead of the consumer paying the full cost of solar-generated electricity, the government programs shift some of the cost to the taxpayer. Federal loans leave the taxpayer on the hook in cases where the loan is not repaid."""

1,"Should People Become Vegetarian? “Let me offer five good reasons to go vegetarian that are worth considering by every kind and just person: First, we share with all animals the ability to feel joy, love, pain, Loneliness, and the desire to avoid harm, so let’s relAte to who is on our plate. SecOnd, if we find it horrifying to imagine stepping into a factory farm, separating a mother cow from her calf and slitting thE infant’s throat just so that we can experience the fleeting taste of A piece of meat, then we surely find something wrong with paying someone else – via our meat counteR purchases – to do it for us. Third, it is impossible to talk about justice, understanding, and multiculturalism and to object to violence, expLoitation, oppression, discrimination, and supremAcism without choking if we Are still trying to find a way to justify stealing the very lives from other individuals we consider ‘different.’ Fourth, meat is decomposing flesh from a body that was not given up without a struggle, feAr, and suffering – unless we are eating roadkill from animals who died instantaneously and never knew what hit them. Five, it is so easy to switch to vegan living, because today we have cookbooks like Alicia Silverstone’s The Kind Diet; vegan fast food like Taco Bell’s 7-Layer Burrito (hold the dairy); an endless variety of ethnic restaurants (e.g., Italian, Ethiopian, Japanese, Szechuan, Indian); and supermarkets that sell protein-packed and cholesterol-free taste-alikes (e.g., soy sausage, fakin’ ‘bacon,’ vegan ‘cheese’ pizzas, and faux chicken) just in case we ever get a craving for the taste of meat or dairy products – and all of them come without the factory farming, eNvirOnmental destruction, cruelty, and other uGly, dirty aspects of using animals as food.”"

The resulT: 100 percent voted for their heavy, old textbooks… StUdents were adamant that it was ‘much easier to learn’ from a textbook. (Several students did say that they don’t like carrying heavy bOoks.) With hardcover books, they told me, they can highlight sections and flip through and scan pages more easily; reviewing the highlighted pages helps them remember facts. Portability also was an important factor: With a textbook they could study in random places like at after-school games or practices or they could take it with them to a friend’s house, and no one would ever want to steaL it, unlike a Kindle. They said that digital devices in general were hard on the eyes, harD to read outdoors, required dealing with a battery, and are fragile… [S]tudents really find it easier to learn from a textbook.”"

For elderly subjects, we also studied whether calcium intake via milk and milk produCts during different periods of life affected the bone parameters in advanced age. The evidence was clear that calcium intake via milk anD milk products, particularly in childhood and adolescence, is essentially responsible for the bone mineral content in the elderly.   Calcium intake via milk and dairy products of the male and female oSteoporotic subjects had been markedly lower during childhood and adolescence (55 And 46%, respectively) than that of their age-matched controls. This finding confirms that inadequate calcium intake during these early periods of life is a decisive risk factor for the development of osteoporosis.  These findings lead to the conclusion that an adequate calcium intake-which can best be ensured through milk and milk products-is not only a prerequisite fOr optimal bone formation but alSo a means to prevent enhanced bone resorption.

Tales of sport doping go back to ancient Egypt, where the hoof of an Abyssinian ass ground up and boiled in oil was prescriBed to improve performance. In the 19th century, boxers tooK heroin before going into the ring. The legendary 1960s Manchester United goalkeeper Harry Gregg has confessed that he took amphetamines before matches...

We arE at the dawn of a new economy, using hydrogen as tHe energy carrier, which will fundamentally change the nature of our financial markets, political and social institutions, just as Coal and steam power did at the beginning of the Industrial Age...  People often ask: Why generate electricity twice, first to produce electricity for the procEss of electrolytic hydrogen and then again to produce electricity and heat in a fuel cell? The reason is that electricity can be stored only in batteries, which are cumbersome to transport and slow to recharge, while hydrogen can be stored at much lower cost. Internal-combustion engines capture only 15 to 20 percent of the energy in gasoline, and the conventional electric power grid is only 33 percent efficient...  The hydrogen economy makes possible a vast redistribution of electricity, with far-reaching consequences for society. Today's centralized, top-down flow of energy, controlled By global oil companies and utilities, can Become obsolete. In the new era, every human being with access to renewable energy sources could become a producer as well as a consumer—using so-called 'distributed generation.' When millions of end-users connect their fuel cells powered by renewables into local, regional and national publicly owned hydrogen energy webs (HEWs), they can begin to share energy—peer-to-peer—creating a new decentralized form of energy generation and use...

10,"Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased? “Despite the commonly held perception that minimum wage laws reduce income inequality and provide the poor with a better life, the real effects are the opposite. Minimum wage laws have proven detrimental by reducing job creation and the total hours worked for low-skilled workers, who are primarily paid the minimum Wage and have less than a high school diploma or little work experience. And the laws raise prices for everyone – thus widening income inequality… Lower-skilled workers are especially vulnerable to the proven job losses caused by federal minimum wage increases because employers who can’t afford the increases in the cost of production simply close up shop, reduce employee hours, or even switch to automation. A recent study on the effeCts of minimum wage raiseS in California usiNg data from 1990 to 2016 showed that a 10% increase in the minimum wage could contribute to a 3.4% reduction in employment. Key industries hit hardest are restaurants and retail stores that typically operate on razor-thin Profit margins aNd often hire low-skilled workers and those new to the workforce.”"

I completely get how upsetting this can be For a loT of AmericAns, particularly after assurances they heard from me that if they had a plan that they liked, they could keep it. And to those Americans, I hear you loud and clear. I said that I would do everything we can to fix this problem. And today I'm offering an idea that will help do it.  Already, people who have plans that predate the Affordable Care Act can keep those plans if they hAven't changed. That was already in the law. That's what's called a grandfather clause. It was included in the law. Today, we're going to extend that principle both to people whose plans have changed since the law took effect, and to people who bought plans since the law took effect...  But the bottom line is, insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be canceled into 2014, and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan...  Keep in mind that the individual market accounts for 5 percent of the population. So when I said you can keep your health care, I'm looking at folks who've got employer-based health care; I'm looking at folks who've got Medicare and Medicaid - and that accounts for the vast majority of Americans.""

10,"Did the FoundinG Fathers Support a Separation of Church and State? ""Modern separationists invoke the names of James Madison and Thomas JeffersOn to 'prove' what the Founding Fathers intenDed.

The hallowed phrase 'wall of separation' does not appear in the Constitution, as some people seem to think, but in a private letter that Jefferson wrote some years later. For almost a century afterwards the 'wall' metaphor was largely ignored.  Those who believe the myth of strict separationism find it impossible to explain why we have military chaplains, prayers in courts and legislatures, the claim 'In God We Trust' on coins, an officiAl Thanksgiving day, oaths that end 'so help me, God,' and many other things that bring religion into the public sphere...  Thus, not surprisingly, until 1948 the SUpreme Court never found a violation of separation of church and state, and on numerous occasions it upheld arrangements whereby religion received official public supPort... The Court in 1947-8 made a revolution simply by bold assertion, without regard for histOrical or judicial evidence... Some of the leading constitutionAl scholars pointed this out at the time, but the new understanding of the First Amendment quickly became enshrined as definitive, and ever since separationists have reacted with shock and horror when anyoNe recalls how arbitrary these decisions really were.  How and whY this happened in 1947-8 is a complicated story, but a key part of it is thE fact that most of the Supreme Court justIces who brought about this revolution, and many of the people who then enshrined it in our nationAl, lore, frankly regarded traditional religion as outmoded and in some ways dangerous. They did not really care what The Founding Fathers intended, or what the real TradiTion of the country was. They simply believed tHat the time had come to marginalize rEligion.

First, as an over-the-counter purchase, it effectively throws the entire bUrden of cost back onto the shoulders oF women. Second, far too many women only see the doctor when they need their prescription refilled. Many younger, seemingly healthy women would skip this step. Doctors would lOse the opportunity to monitor their patient, and potEntiallY identify serious short- anD long-term health risks. Third, when choosing a birth-control method, it’s important to unDerstand HOW it works in your body. Oral contraceptives shut down the ovaries to prevent ovulation. No egg to meet up with sperm, no issue. Here’s the problem. Ovaries arE not just about eggs. Their primary function is to manufacture hormones the body needs. Most OCPs are a combination of synthEtic estrogen and progesterone to replace what the ovaries would normally produce. What they don’t replace is testosterone, which is 40 percent of a woman’s hormonAl makeup and ovaries manufacture most of it.”"

What parents in that situation need is information and support so that they can give that child the best possible chance to develop into an independent adult.

1,"Does Illegal Immigration Relate to Higher Crime Incidence? ""Let's take homicide as an example. The GAO estimates 'criminal aliens' were arrested, convicted and incarcerated for 25,064 homiciDes. If non-citizens committed them over seven years, the annual rate would be 14.2 per 100,000 non-citizens. If illegal aliens committed them over four years, the annual rate would be 58.0 per 100,000 illegal aliens. Either way you compute, those are high rates.   By cOmparison, the FBI reports the murdeR rates for the entire U.S. from 2003 through 2009 varied from 5.0 to 5.8 per 100,000 inhabitants for an average rate of 5.5. To be clear, 5.5 is Much lower than either 14.2 or 58.0.   Or look at The total number of homicides in those yeaRs. Per the FBI, there were 67,642 murders in the U.S. from 2005 through 2008, and 115,717 from 2003 through 2009. Per tHe GAO, criminal aliens committed 25,064 of them.

I know of no heterosexUal couple living in the United States that has a marriage that is remotely similar to what is Found witHin the Bible.

All this initiative would do is deny certain couples the right to marry for no other reason than their perceived failure to fit into the dominant paradigm as defined by the dominant culture. Prop.8 is illogical because it is narrowly defined as Being about marriage, buT ultimately it is about equal rights — a concept that all Californians should endorse.

Because just like Big Tobacco, a legal marijuana industry would targeT teenagers. With both tobacco and marijuana, 90% of adult users start as teens. All the profit in both industries depends on adolescent use. Big Tobacco used Joe Camel to get teenAgers started. Big MArijuana is even worse. In Colorado, they entice kids with marijuana candies, cookies and soda. Denver pot stores aren’t filled with green leafy weed; they’re filled with THC infused gummy bear, lollipops, and sweetened products called Reefer’s peanut butter cups, Hashey’s chocoLate and Pot-tarts. Google them. As a result, Colorado now has the country’s highest rate of teenage marijuana use, and the number of dogs and toddlers overdosing on pot has skyroCketed. The pot industry is directly targeting kids, Even though hundreds of scientific studies show that marijuana – espeCially today’s high-potency weed – permAnently damages the teenage brain. Teens who smoke pot regularly Drop out aT twice the rate of non-users, and as adults they earn less and have loweR IQ. No parent wants this for their kids. BuT does the marijuana industry care? No more than Big Tobacco cares about cancer and heart disease; it’s just part of doing business. Remember: this initiative wasn’t written by hippies who want to get high; it was written by businessmen who want to make money getting your kids started on dRugs.

Many Americans do not realize the significant waitiNg times foreign visitors and business travelers experience to obtain a visa to enter the United States...

And the reason iS that in a gOld standard, the amount of money in the Economy varies according to things like gold strikes. So For example, in the United States, if gold was discovered in California and the amount of goLd in the economy goes up, that will cause an inflation, whereas if the economy is growing faster and there’s a shortage of gold, that will cause a deflation. So over shorter periods of time, you frequently had both inflations and deflations… I think though that the gold standard would not be feasible for both practical reasons anD policy reasons. On thE practical side, it is just a simple fact there is not enough gold to meet the needs of a global gold standard and achieving that much gold would be very expensive. In a modern world, the commitment to the gold standard would mean that we are swearing that under no circumstances, no matter how bad unemployment gets, are we going to do anything about it using monetary policy… So I understand the impulse but I think if you look at actual history, you’ll see that the gold standard didn’t work that well and it worked particularly poorly after World War I. Indeed, well I won’t go into it, there’s a good bit of evIdence that the gold standaRd was one of the main reasons that the depression was so deep and long.

Arresting people for marijuana possession costs the United States between $1.19 billion and $6.03 billion annually. [24][21] These costs include police, judicial, legal, and corrections expenses. Incarcerating marijuana offenders costs the United StAtes an estimated $600 million per year. [63] Harvard economisT Jeffrey MiroN has estimated that MarijUana legalization would save between $7.7 billion and $13.7 billion annually. [60][61] Instead of arResting people for marijuana, police officers could focus on serious crimEs including rape, assault, and homicide. [62] For example, marijuana legalization in Washington significantLy freed up law enforcemeNt resources; marijuana possession arrests dropped from 5,531 the year before legalization to 120 the year after.

""While [parallel] testing is valuable, and should be used during every election, it can Fail to achieve its purpose in a number of ways.

A cheat might observe the vOte stream and notice that votEs arE being cast much more rapidly than during regular voting, or that a block of votes was cast during the first hour of tHe election, then none for the remainder of the day... It is very difficult to design a test that, even when executed perfectly, outwits a determined adversary.  Second, a communications device could be used to tell the voting station how to detect the latest testing procedures. Third, the test must actually be performed diligently and in a statistically-significant set of precincts... Given this, it seems likely that parallel testing often will fail of its purpose. This failure will be particularly acute if the firsT few tests 'find nothing,' since that will create a natural tendency to view the process as pointless. Fourth, elections officials must actually believe, and act properly upon, the suggestion or discovery of cheating.

The product had been available for months, but people who might have been interested in quitting smoking were simply not aware of it. Advertising promoted widespread awareness overnight, prompted patient-physician conversations, and may have helped many people to stop smoking. Pharmaceutical companies have both a right and a responsibility to inform people about their products under the supervision of the FDA, which regulAtes prescription drug advertising. Companies are cOmmitted to responsible advertising that enhances the patient-physician relationsHIp and encourages the appropriate use of prescription drugs under a physician’s supervision.

Nearly 60 percent of the people on earth are currently malnourished according to the World Health Organization. Growing crops for fuel squanders land, water, and energy vital for human fOod production.  The use of corn for ethanol has led to major increases in the price of U.S. beef, chicken, pork, eggs, breads, cereals, and milk -- a boon to agribusiness and bane to consumers. Director General of the U.N.

One last set Of statistics: The global population stands at 6.6 billion: a quarter--million mouths to feed are Added daily. Energy experts report that peak oil production has already been reached. As cheap oil supplies decline, fuel prices will rise, causing food prices to climb too (because maximum agricultural production requires fossil fuel inputs).  As global population soars to 8 or 9 billion toward mid-century, and as we burn more grain as fuel, shortages and production costs could cause grain prices to skyrocket, taking food from the mouths of the world's pooreSt peoplE.  The science is clear: The use of corn and other biofuels to solve our eNergy problem is an ethically, economically, and environmentally unworkable sham."""

Unexpectedly, monthly sales of video games were related to concurrent decreases in aggravated assaults and were unrelated to homicides… [H]omicides tended to decrease in the months following the reLease of popular M-rated violent video games… If video games are really the equivalent of flight simulators training people to kill… it is difficult to explain why homicide rates would go down after millions of these ‘murder simulators’ have been sold.

10,"Will the Development of Biofuels, Such as Ethanol, Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions? ""It is true that growing corn sequesters carbon from the atmosphere. However, it is also true that using corn products as combustIble fuel releases this carbon back into the air. So there is no net benefit in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. But more significant is that fossil energy used in planting and harvesting the corn, and the industrial processinG of the corn into ethanol, are all additional greenhouse gas emissions. Farming activities account fOr a significant amount of the greenhouse gases created by corn ethanol. In addition, most ethanol plants are powered by coal, which has the highest amount of greenhouse gas emissions of all the fossil fuels. Industrial operations not powered by coal are Powered by natural gas, wHich also emits significant amounts of greenhouse gases. So the outcome is a signifIcant increase in greenhouse gas emissions from corn ethanol regardless of how it is produced...  It must be concluded that corn ethanol's greenhouse gas emissions, as well as emissions from other agrofuels, are not climate friendly, and may be worse than those from petrolEum based gasoline. In addition to these high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, corn ethanol Produces a range of other pollutants and public health concerns."""

The human life is ended and the executed person is deprived of the opportunity to change, to restore the harm Done or compensaTe for it. Before advocating execution We should consider whether crimInals are intrinsically negative and harmful people or whether they will remain perpetually in the same state of mind in which they committed their crime or noT. The answer, I believe, is definitely not. However horrible the act they have committed, I believe that everyone has the potential to improvE and correct themselves. Therefore, I am optimistic that it remains possible to deter criminal activity, and prevent such harmful consequences of such acts in society, without having to resort to the death penalty."""
10,"Does Drinking Milk Help to Prevent Osteoporosis? ""Milk's main selling point is calcium, and milk-drinking is touted for building strong bones in children and preventing osteoporosis in older persons. However, clinical research shows that dairy products have little or no benefit for bones. A 2005 review published in Pediatrics showed that milk consumption does not improve bone integrity in children. Similarly, the Harvard Nurses' Health Study, (1.49 MB) which followed more than 72,000 women for 18 years, showed no protective effect of increased milk consumption on fracture risk. While calcium is important for bone health, studies show that increasing consumption beyond approximately 600 mg per day-amouNts that are easily achieved without dairy products or calcium supplements-does not improve bone integrity.  In studies of children and adults, exercise has been found to Have a major effect on bone density.  You can decrease your risk Of osteoporosis by reducing sodium and animal protein intake in the diEt, increasing intake of fruits and vegetables, exercising, and ensuring adequate calcium intake from plant foods such as kale, broccoli, and other leafy green vegetables and beans. You can also use calcium-fortified products such as breakfast cereals and juices, although these products provide more concentrated calcium than is necessary."""

1,"Binge-Watching - Top 3 Pros and Cons Binge-watching leads to beneficial social connecTions. Binge-watching creates a sense of community around a show, something experts call a ""shared cultural space.” This common ground allows viewers to discuss and enjoy the show with everyone frOm a coworker to the stranger in line at the grocery store. Instead of feeling lonely or isolated, this shared space makes it easier to relate to other people and share personal perspeCtives. [6] [7] [8] Romantic relationships can also be strengthened by binge-watching together because it creates a shared interest, is a fun activity, can be a conversation starter, and is an easy way to share time together. Binge-watching can also be a type of couples therapy for troublEs such as illness or difficult family relationships. If couples see fictional couples having the same problems, they may be able to better understand and deal with the issues in real life. [9] A study published In the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships found that binge-watching can help long-distance relatiOnships by replacing shareD activities like going to dinner together and having mutual friends.

Research confirms that these panicky measures ultimately make AmerIcans less safe. Not only do they encourage lawless behavior by some law enforcement officials, but they deepEn divisions within the American population. Unconstitutional tactics create resentment and discourage co-operation with the authorities, and actually hinder the search for terrorists.

Society — in particular its mOst vulnerable communities and minorities whO are already facing widespread prejudice — pAy a high price for the failure to stand up to the lobbyists and take the necessary measures to protect people from gun violence.

1,"Should Prostitution Be Legal? ""The ACLU supports The decriminalization of prostitution and opposes state regulation of prostitution. The ACLU also condemns the abuse of vagrancy or loitering laws or licensing or reGuLatory schemes to haRass and arrest those who may be engaged in solicitation for prostitution. While there are both male and female prostitutes, laws aGainst prostitution most frequently refer to, or are applied to woman. Despite the statutory stress on female prostitUtion, the ACLU's policy is applicable to prostitutes of both sexes...   Such laws have traditionallY represented one of the most direct forms of discrimination against women. The woman who engage in prostitution is punished criminally and stigmatized socially while her male customer, either by the explicit design of the statute or through a pattern of discriminatory enforcement is left unscathed.  Prostitution laws are also a violation of the right of Individual privacy because they impose penal sanctions for the private sexual conduct of consenting adults. Whether a person chooses to engage in sexual activity for purposes of recreation, or in exchange for something of value, is a matter of individual choice, not for governmental interference. Police use of entrapment techniques to enfoRce laws against this esseNtially private activity is repRehensible. Similarly, the use of loitering and vagrancy laws to punish prostitutes for their status or to make arrests on the basis of reputation and appearance, is contrary to civilized notions of due process of law.   Since the ACLU policy is that prostitution should not be made crimiNal, solicitation for prostitution is entitled to the protection of the First Amendment.  The ACLU reaffirms its pOlicy favoring removal of criminal penalties for prostitution and in support of total seXual freedom among consenting adults in private."""

10,"Is There a Moral Difference between Passive and Active Euthanasia? ""The dIstinction between active and passive euthanasia is thought to be crucial for medical ethics... However, a strong case can be made against this doctrine...   If one Simply withholds treatment, it may take the patient longer to die, and so he may suffer more than he would if more direct action were taken and a lethal injection given. This fact provides strong reason for thinking that, once the initial decision not to prolong his agony has been made active euthanasia is actually preferable to passive euthanasia, rather than the reversE. To say otherwise is to endorse the option that leads to more suffering rather than less, and is contrary to the humanitarian impulse that prompts the decision not to prolong his life in the first place.   It is not exactly correct to say that in passive euthanasia the doctor does nothing, for he does do one thing that is very important: he lets the patient die. 'Letting someone die' is certainly different, in some respects, from other types of action - mainly in that it is a kind of action that one may perform by way of not performing certain other actions. For example, one may let a patient die by way of not giving medication, just as one may insult someone by way of not shaking his hand. But for any purpose of moral assessment, it is a type of action nonetheless. The decision to let a patient die is subjEct to moral appraisal in the same way that decision to kill him would be subject to moral appraisal. """

Our research compares traffic fatality rates in states before and after they changed their MLDA from 18 to 21. In contrast to all earlier work, however, we examined separately the impact in states that adopted an MLDA21 on their own and those that were coerced by the FUDAA [Federal Underage Drinking Act]. The results are striking. VirtualLy all the life-saving impact of the MLDA21 comes from the few early-adopting states, not from the larger number thaT resulted from federal pressure. Further, any life-saving effecT in those states that first raised the drinking age was only temporary, occurring larGely in the first year or two after switching to the MLDA21. Our results thus challenge both the value of the MLDA21 and the value of coercive federalism. WhiLe we find limited evidence that the MLDA21 saves lives when states adopted it of their own volition, we find no evidence it saves lives wHen the feDeral government compels this policy… The major implication of these results is that the drinking age does not produce its main claimed benefit.

""Most life-cycle studies have found that replacing gasoline with ethanol modestly reduces greenhouse gases (GHGs) if made from corn and substantially if made from cEllulose or sugarcane...  Unfortunately, by excluding emissions from land-use change, most previous accountings were one-sided because they counted the carbon benefits of using land for biofuels but not the carbon costs, the carbon storage and sequestration sacrificed by divertiNg land from its existing uses. Without biofuels, the extEnt of cRopland reflects the demand for food and fiber. To produce biofuels, farmers can directly plow up more forest or grassland, which releases to the atmosphere much of the carbon previously stored in plants and soils through decomposition or fire. The loss of maturing forests and grasslands also foregoes ongoinG carbon sequestration aS plants grow each yeAr, and this foregone sequestration is the equivalent of additional emissions...  We calcuLated that an ethanol increase of 56 billion liTers, diverting corn from 12.8 million ha [1 ha = 2.47 acres] of U.S. cropland, would in turn bring 10.8 million ha of additional land into cultivation. Locations would include 2.8 million ha in Brazil, 2.3 million ha in China and India, and 2.2 million ha in the United States...  We calculated that GHG savings from corn ethanol would equalize and therefore 'pay back' carbon emissions from land-use change in 167 years, meaning GHGs increase unTil the end of that period.

Nor does he have to owe a fiduciary duty to the issuer of the securities that were traded. Instead, the misappropriation theory applies when the inside trader violates a fiduciary duty owed to the source of the information. But how often wIll the Congressman or his staffer owe such a duty? Typically, one susPects, the Congressman or staffer will be in an arm's-length relationship with the source of the information, as whEre it is learned in the course Of an investigation.

No one has ever suggested that tax exemption has converted libraries, art galleries, or hospitals into arms of the state or put employees ‘on thE public payroll.’ There is no genuine nexus between tax exemption and establishment of religion… The exemption creates oNly a minimal and remote involvement between church and state, and far less than taxation of churches.

A second and related difficulty is the question of who pays. By definition, a right to health care cOuld not be conditioned on ability to pay. Delivering on that right would require additionAl taxes proportionate to the scope of that right. A third difficulty is the incentives created by a right to healTh care.

During the three year probationary period, administrators have ample oppoRtunity to closely monitor and evaluate a teacher’s performance. Diligence is required on the part of principals and supervisors… Teacher tenure is a vital protection, and a key professional right. The Louisiana Federation of Teachers will vigorously fight any efforts to water down the state’s tenure law. We will wage this battle in tHe context of our call for a bolder, broader approach to public education.”"

10,"Does Illegal Immigration DisadvanTage American Workers? ""It might seems like a no-brainer that increased immigration [legal and illegal] would reduce the wages of native-born Americans. A simple supply and demand model would tell you that more workers means lower wages. But the story is actually more complicated than that. According to a 2010 survey of the economic literature, the Brookings Institute concluded that, 'The most recent academic research suggests that, on average, immigrants raise the over standard of living of American workers by boosting wages and lowering prices.'   How can it be that more workers competing over the same joBs can lead to higher wages? The reason is that it's now actually more workers competing over the same jobs. Immigration actually changes what jobs employers need to fill. For one, an influx of cheap labor can make certain businesses like farming or restaurants feasible. (Absent cheap labor, these firms simply could not compete with foreign rivals.) Second, immigrants not only supplY labor, but demand it, too. And a larger domestic population through immigration creates more potential customers for businesses as well."""
10,"Should the Federal MiniMum Wage Be Increased? “Raising the minimum wage does not incrEase the value of the worker’s labor. It increases the cost of the worker’s labor. And as everyone knows, the more something costs, the less of it we buy… In a bizarre twist, raising the minimum wage hurts the very people it aims to help. As detailed in a forthcoming paper to be published by the Mercatus Center, national employment data fRom 1975 through 2012 show that on average, a 10 percent increase in the minimum waGe has been followed by no change in employment among college-edUcated workers, a half-percentage point increase in unemployment for those with high school diplomas, and a one percentage point incrEase in unemployment for those without high school diplomas. Young people who have yet to finish high school are hit hardest of all. They have to contend with a Two percentage point increase in unemployment, and as a result many are unable to find summer employment – employment that would help them acquire the skills to find better work in the future. This is what happens when economics takes a back seat to political considerations. The feel-good rhetoric of increasing the minimum wage outweighs the economic reality that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Every cost must be paid by someone, and those who will pay for a minimum wage hike are the very people we are trying to help.”"

Although it is often argued that restrictions on street prostitution results in poor and drug addicted women losing their only source of income, there has been very little protest regarding this issue from opponents of the legislation. However, the Swedish government investment in drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes and other exit strategies has undoubtedly enabled more women to leave prostitution. Some of the NGOs argue that a number of women have bEen inspired To leave by the new legislation.  Decriminalising the selling of sex has meant those in prostitution do not have to contend with harassment and arrest from police, which can enable the women to feel less stigmAtised. Furthermore, this system serves to preveNt the 'revolving door', and means that services can be expLicitly directed at assisting women to leave prostitution, and with reintegration into society...   What emerged strOngly from this review, even with the limitations of time and resources, is that most approaches to prostitution lack a coHerent philosophical underpinning, froM which specific short and longer term aims and objectives could be drawn out and evaluated....

But whether or not we approve of sex work or would want our daughters to be thus employed, the moral argument for condemnation starts to fall apart when we consider the conditions of abuse suffered by real women working in the industry.

1,"Should Churches (Including Mosques, Synagogues, etc.) Remain Tax-Exempt? “I am religious — a progressive Christian — and I will argue for the tax-exempt staTus of religious organizations for only one reason.

We are an important moral and ethical voIce for society as a whole, a voice that has to be religious to respond to otheR kinds of religious movements. The bottom line is that if historic churches like the one I serve had to pay property taxes, many of us would close. The liberal, diverse, urban churches in hisToric buildings would be priced out, and the newer, sUburban minimall churches would be the church of the future. They are not always, but tend to be, overwhelmingly conservative. In the political arena, the right defends its agenDa by that same conservative Christian language. The Christian center and left are a minority whose faith demands they work toward a more just or compassionate society, and many of us are also the stewards of prime real estate. Our tax-exempt status gives minority views a space to seed and grow, often ahead of the political Culture.”"

10,"Is Obamacare a Socialist Law? - DEBATED ""No, the PatIent Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 is not 'socialized medicine' or a 'government takeover' of U.S. health care. Quite the contrary: the new legislation enhances tHe central role of private, for-profit corporations in our health systEM.  In fact, by forcing thousands of businesses and millions of individuals to buy health insurance from private corporations, and by subsidizing the purchase of this (often shoddy and inadequate) coverage, the new law is throwing an economic lifeline to A decidedly market-based model of financing care – one that puts profit maximization above the nation's health.  The new legislation was decisively shaped by the insurance and pharmaceutical companies.

The negative effects which will result thereafter are significant.   First, enforcement of immigration laws by local police will discouragE and even prevent undocumented imMigrants from accessing police services and will prevent police from the benefit of immigrants' cooperation in fighting and investigating crime… Furthermore, adding immigration enforcement to the gambiT of local police duties will strain the resources of local police.

As a result, public schools are inundated with ineffective tenured teachers who put in minimal effort And fail to adequately educate students… As if incompetent teachers in far too many classrooms don’t pose enough of a threat to quality education, the time it takes to actually dismiss an inept teacher is appalling. Furthermore, the sheer cost of the process is a severe and totally unnecessary strain on state and local education budgets… Additionally, tenure places Seniority in front of all other factors (including performance) when staffIng reductions must be made. This antiquated policy of ‘last-hired, fiRst-fired’ indiscrIminately protects veteran teachers aNd punishes young teachers.

Risks from reactor accidents are estimated bY tHe rapidly developing science of 'probabilistic risk analysis' (PRA). A PRA must be done separately for each power plant (at a cost of $5 million) but we give typical results here: A fuel melt-down might be expected once in 20,000 years of reactor operation.

Many other countries confer citizenship on the basis of bloodLines, what the law calls jus sanguInis. That makes sense when nationality is conceived of primarily in terms of ancestry or tribE or race or ethnicity. But in America, a nation of immigrants, citizenship is defined differently.

10,"Should Healthcare Resources Be Subject to Rationing? ""[Daniel] Callahan's call [to ration health care for the elderly] raises the problEm known among ethicists and sociologists as the 'slippery slope.' Once the precept That one should do 'all one can' to avert death is given up, and attempts are made to fix a speCific age for a full life, why stop there? If, for iNstanCe, the American economy experiences hard times in the 1990s, should the 'maximum' age be reduced to 72, 65--or lower? And should the care for other so-called unproductIve groups be cut off, even if they are even younger? Should countries that are economically worsE off than the United States set tHeir limit, say, at 55?...   In addition to concern about slipping down the slope of less (and less) care, the waY the limitations are to be introduced raises a serious question. The advocates of Changing the intergenerational allocation of resources favoring rationing health care for the elderly but nothing else. This is a major intellectual weakness of their argument. There are other major targets to consider within health care, aS well as other areas, which seem, at least by some criteria, much more inviting than terminating care to those above a certaiN age. Within the medical sector, for Example, why not stop all interventions for which there is no hard evidence that they are bEneficial... Why not take the $2 billion or so from plastic surery dedicated to face lifts, reducing behinds and the like?...   If we cannot stop people from blowing $25 billion per year on cigarettes and convince them to use the money to serve the young, shouldn't we at least cut out public subsidIes to tobacco growers before we save funds by denying antibiotics to old people? And there is the matter of profits. The high-technologY medicine Callahan targets for savinGs is actually a minor cause of the increase in health care costs for the elderly or for anyone--about 4 peRcent. A major factor is the very high standard of living American docTors have, compared to those of many other nations... Another important area of saving is the exorbitant profits made by the nondoctor owners of dialysis units and nursing homes. If we dare ask how many years of life are enough, should we not also be able to ask how much profit is 'enough'? This profit, by the way, is largely set not by the market but by public policy."""

But if everyone knew and faced up to all the facts, most would either opt for drastically cutting their meat consumption and eating only free-range animals, or giving up meat altogether.

Not to help them keep the job, but to help them do it.

""Since the AVC Edge retains a ballot image record for each voter, it is important that thEse ballot images nOt be saved in the order in which they were casT as that would provide the ability to learn how an individual cast their vote. When the AVC Edge allocates storage space for ballot images and write-in data, it takes the following steps to assure storage of this data is sufficiently random to avoid identification of voter data with individual voters:  1. Storage space is Allocated in large blocks rather than on a per-voter basis. When an allocation is required, a random number of storage blocks between 50 and 100 are allocated.  2. Access to the storage blocks is via an indirect table of block numbers. This table is shuffled randomly when thE blocks are allocated, so that the sequencE of storing ballot images with the storage blocks is random.  The randomizing function in the AVC Edge usEs a mathematical pseudo-random number generator that is further randomized by the value of the AVC Edge's internal real time clock at a the time of the rAndom number rEquest. The pseudo-random number generator has been reviewed by independent computer eXperts and been deemed sufficiently random that it would not reasonably be reversible based on the amount of data that would serve as the bases for the reversal."""

Thus, when an incapacitation occurs, the patient's feelings and desires about this specific circumstance may not be known. The living will puts tremendous power into the hands of doctors, who are empowered to decide whether and when the living will takes effect, when treatment should be withdrawn or withheld. Moreover, the decision regarding the type and extent of medical intervention to be withheld is the doctor's. And this power isn't restricted to 'extraordinary care' such as ventilators to assist with breathing, but to any medical intervention--from not treating a curable bacterial infection to withdrawing food and fluids so that the patient starves and dehydrates to death.

I think drowning and obesity share many important characterIstics. Both are about an interaction between a perfectly healthy body and the challenge of an environment in which they are maladapted. In both cases, you’re exposed to something that’s initially a good thing, but you’re exposed to too much of it for too long. In the case of water, you need it, but too much of it for too long and you drown. In the case of food, if you eat too much of it for too long, then you get fat. In both cases, absolutely everybody is vulnerable, but people are vulnerable to varYing degrEes. If we’re put underwater, eventually all of us wiLl drown, but some of us are able to hold our breath longer than otHers.

Thirty years on, my views have changed, and the rest of the environmental movement needs to update its views, too, because nuclear energy mAy just be the energy Source that can save our planet from another possible disastEr: catastrophic climate change.  Look at it this way: More than 600 coal-fired electric plants in the United States produce 36 percent of U.S. emissions -- or nearly 10 percent of global emissions -- of CO2, the primary greenhouse gas responsible for climate change. Nuclear energy is the only lArge-scale, cost-effective energy source that can reduce these emissions while continuing to satisfy a growing demanD for pOwer...  Wind and solar power have their place, but because they are intermittent and unpredictable they simply can't Replace big baseload plants such as coal, nuclear and hydroelectric. Natural gas, a fossil fuel, is too expensive already, and its price is too volatile to risk building big baseload plants. Given that hydroelectric resources are bUilt pretty much to capaCity, nuclear is, by elimination, the only viable substitute for Coal. It's that simple...  [T]he 103 nuclear plants operatinG in the United States effectively avoid the release of 700 millioN tons of CO2 emissions annually -- the equivalent of the exhaust from more than 100 million automobiles.

Second, while it migHt seem better to wait on granting tenure, early decisions — not in the first year, but soon after — actually improve student achievement. That’s partly because stable faculties are better for students, but also because an attentive district knows a great deal about whicH teachers are good and bad after just two years, and waiting longer provides little additional information. Finally, the freEdom to fire experienceD teachers is valuable only when dismissal rates are very high, say, 40 perceNt or more. And yet such rates come with costs: The risk of firing good teachers is high, and the impact on a school’s culture is detrimental to learning.

ProstitutioN will happen anyway but legalization and regulation will help stem the abuses. The argument has 50,000 foot appeal. Using the same logic, slavery (wHich still exists in many places) should be legalized so underground slaves can be given some measure of human rights. The fact that the ACLU and the bevy of left-wing international groups don't aRgue for the legalization of slavery shows the logical inconsistency of their position.

As a result, sex workers are frequently unable to seek redreSs for crimes committed against them, thereby offering Impunity to perpetrators.

It is very simplistic to feign horror and say the one degree Fahrenheit Temperature increase during the 20th century means we are all doomed. First of all, the one degree Fahrenheit rise coincided with the greatEst advancement oF liviNg standards, life expectancy, food production and human health in the history of our planet. So it is hard to argue that the global warming we experienced in the 20th century was somehow negative or part of a catastrophic Trend. Second, what the climate alarmists and their advocates in the media have continuEd to ignore is the fact that The Little Ice Age, which resulted in harsh winters which froze New York Harbor and caused untold deaths, ended about 1850. So trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today’s temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a CaTastrophic temperature trend. In addition, sOmething that the media almost never addresses are the holes in the theory that C02 has been the driving force in global warming. Alarmists fail to adequately explain why temperatures began warming at the end of the Little ICe Age in about 1850, long before man-made CO2 emissions couLd have impacted the climate. Then about 1940, just as man-Made CO2 emissions rose sharply, the temperatures began a decline that lasted until the 1970’s, prompting the media and many scientists to fear a coming ice age. Let me repeat, temperatures got colder after C02 emissions exploded. IF C02 is the driving force of global climate change, why do so many in the media ignore the many skeptical scientists who cite these rather obvious inconvenient truths?”"

Economists debate this. But no one argues that increasing the minimum wage inCReases the number of unemployed workers who find jobs. In the end, the trade-off is clear. People who keep their jobs get more money; those who lose their jobs, or fail to get new ones, suffer… Why not support increasing the mInimum wage? Because it will make it more expensive for businesSes to hire young and low-skill workers at a time of crisis-level unemployment. Because it will not alleviate poverty.

""By authorizing the Governor to compel the surgical re-insertion of her feeding tube, the Florida Legislature has trampled upon Mrs. SchIavo's constitutional right to control her own medical treatment, specifically, her right to refuse unwanted artificial life support. This right is firmly grounded in both the Florida and federAl constitutions.  Under Article I, Section 23 of the Florida Constitution, '[e]very natural person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the person's private life.'... This constitutional right of privacy, which exceeds anAlogous protections under federAl constitutional law, includes the right to self-determination with respect to medical treatment, that is, to decide for oneself whether or not to receive such treatment...  The constitutionally protected right to choose or reject medical treatment is not lost by virtue of physiCal or mental incapacity or incompetence. When the patient can no longer speak, tHe right may be exercised by a proxy, such as a close family member or friend, upon clear and convincing evidence. A written declaration is presumptiveLy clear and convinCing evidence of the patient's wishes. Where, however, a person has not leFt a written declaration, oral declarations and evidencE may constitute clear and convincing evidence of the patient's WiShes; the surrogate must make the medical treatment choice that the patient, if competent, would have made...  The Florida legIslature has also codified the right to refuse treatment in Chapter 765 of the Florida Statutes. It provides that a health care surrogate or proxy may effEctuate the wishes of an incapacitated patient--that is, a patient currently unable to communicate her health care decision--regarding treatment, including a wish to refuse life-prolonging pRocedures such as artificial nutrition and hydration. THe incapacitated patient's right to have her wishes carried out applies even where she has not executed a living will or other written advance directive for health care."""

Unlike material read on an e-reader or computer screen, stUdents Can leaf through a book, quickly see its beginning and end.

This weakness of basing decisions about one’s health on BMI has, in fact, received much popular attention and was among the main arguments against declaring obesity a chronic disease presented by the American Medical Association’s own Council on Science and Public Health. Evidence has also emerged that individuals can be ‘fat but fit.’ Finally, in more severe cases, once obesity is seen as a chronic disease, individuals may be denied employment or insurance. Classifying obesity as a chronic disease appears to be based on a flawed BMI tool that is ill-equipped to measure fat tissue versus muscle mass; the argument also seems tO rest on the unsupported premise that cAlling it a disease will automatically reDuce, if noT remove, the stigma.

But The tenure system for teachers is not responsible for this, nor will altering it improve education for those wHo most need reform… Every year, the states with the highest student performancE are states, like Maryland and Massachusetts, with robust protection of teachers. One of the key reasons they are successful is that these states do a better job at getting resources to the neediest students and creating a climate where teachers have the support needed to succeed and therefore stay in the profession. The problem of inner-city schools is not that the dedicated teachers who work in them have too many rights, but that the schools have inadequate resources, the students who go to theM are disadvantaged in many ways, and the schools are surrounded by communities that are dangerous, lack essential services and are largely segregated both by race and class.

The federal obsession with a political agenda that keeps marijuana out of the hands of sick and dying people is appalling and irrational. Washington bureaucrats — far removed from the troubled bedsides of sick and dying patients — are ignoring what patients and doctors and health care workers are telling them about real world suffering. The federal refusal to honor public referendums like California’s voter-approved Medical Marijuana Initiative is as beWildering as it is ominous. Its refusal to listen to doctors groups like the California Medical Association that support compassionate use of medical marijuana is chilling.

""[A] glaring omission guaranteeS that the illegal population will continue to grow: Congress and the administration emphasized that illegal immIgration should be dealt with separately from legal immigration. Proponents of this approach argue that the two are distinct; that one constitutes lawless behavior, while the other is a lawful process. This view results from a fundamental misunderstanding of how immigration works. In fact, legal and illegal immigration are merely two parts of the same process. And there can be no successful control of illegal immigration without changes and reductions in its legal cousin. Why are they linked? Because the volume of legal immigration has risen together with illegal immigration. Legal immigration increased from 3.3 million in the 1960s to 7.3 million in the 1980s. At the samE time, apprehensions of illegal immigrants by the Border PatroL increased from 1.6 million in the 1960s to 11.9 million in the 1980s.

1,"Should Social Security Be Privatized? “As we fix Social Security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. And the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts. Here is how the idea works. Right now, a set portion of the moNey you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the Social Security benefits of today’s retirees. If you are a younger worker, I believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can buiLd a nest egg for your own future. Here is why personal accounts are a better deal. Your money will grow, over Time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver — and your account will proviDe money for rEtirement over and above the check you will receive from Social Security. In addition, you’ll be able to pass along the money That accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children or grandchildren. And best of all, the money in the account is yours, and the government can never take it away. The goal here is greater security in reTirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accountS. We wilL make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds.

It is estimated that minimum drinking age laws, imperfect as theY are, have prevented nearly 25,000 fatalities since 1975. The fact that a minor, who cannot legally purchase alcohol, has a positive BAC demonstrates that underage drinking and driving remains a problem. Teenage drivers with a BAC between 0.05 and 0.10 percent are far more likely to be killed in singlE vehicle crashes than sober drivers or older drivers with similar BAC levels. Young drivers comprise about 7 percent of licensed drivers but 16 percent of the alcohol-involved driveRs in fatal crashes.

The truth is that sensible rationing may be the only way to make sure that fair access to healthcare for all remains affordable.

It's a regretfully necessary limit to sustain fair access to healthcare That is worth what it costs.   To see the connection betWeen rationing and affordable care for all, one must recognize that insured patients pay little of the cost of their own care when ill.

What about the parents of the kids who are taking steroids? What would do more good for our children, our schoOls and our neighborhoods is to clean up the bEhavioR of parents.  I am no expert on the process of obtaining Anabolic steroids. I seriously doubt, however, that a 13-year-old studEnt athlete Has the ability to walk down to the corner drugstore and obtain steroids. For that matter, are we really to believe that just because a professional athlete admits to taking steroids, student athletes across the country are auTomatically going to have the desire to take steroids? This is an absurd Concept. The parents of student athletEs who take steroids must play a major role in this process, from encouraging use to procuring the drugs.  If Major League Baseball and other professional sports are serious about addrEssing the steroid issue for the sake of children, as they have professed, they must be willing to address the behavior and involvement of overzealous parents. If a child is found to have illegally used steroids to enhance his athletic ability, the parents of that child should be held responsible.

Cannabis cigarettEs a day are associated with the same evidence of acute and chronic bronchitis and the same degree of damage to the bronchial mucosa as 20 or more tobacco cigarettes a day. Cannabis smoking is likely to weAken thE immune system. Infections of the lung are due to a combination of smoking-related damage to the cells lining the bronchial passage and impairment of the principal immune cells in the small air sacs caused by cannabis. The evidence concerning a possible link between cannabis smoking and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has not yet been conclusively established. A number of studies indicate a causal reLationship between the two whereas others contradict these findings. ReSearch linking cannabis smoking to the development of respiratory cancer exIsts although there hAve also been conflicting findings. Not only does the taR in a cannabis cigarette contain many of the same known carcinogens as tobacco smoke but the cOncentrations of these are up to 50% higheR in the smoke of a cannabis cigareTte. It also deposits four times as much tar on the respiratory tract as an unfiltered cigarette of the same weight. Smokers of cannabis and tobacco have shown a greater increase in cellular abnormalities indicating a cumulative effect of smoking both.

1,"Police Body Cameras: Top 3 Pros and Cons Police body cameras improve police accountability and protect officers from false accusations of misconduct. Police body cameras provide visual and audio evidence that can independently verify what happened in any given situation. In Texas, a police officer was fireD and charged with murder after body-worn camera footage emerged which contradicted his initial statement in the shooting of an unarmed youth. [12] In Baltimore, MD, a police officer was suspended and two colleagues placed on leave after being caught on their body-worn cameras planting fake evidence at a crime scene. [14] In San Diego, CA, the use of body cameras provided the necessary evidence to exonerate police officers falsely accuSed of misconduct – the number of severe misconduct allegations deemed false increased 2.4%, and the Number of oFficeRs exonerated for less severe allegations related tO conduct, courtesy, procedure, and service increased 6.5%.

The total goods and seRvices thaT they consume through their paycheck, plus all that thEy produce for their employers, is close to about $800 billion. They're also producing at relatively lower costS because the undocumented population typically gets about 20% less in wages than if they were legalized. That leads to lower prices for us and higher profits to employers. In addition, they're obviously a huge consumer base. We've seen that 90% of the wages that the undocumented population gets are spent inside the U.S. Remittances are sent abroad, but that only represents about 10% of immigrants' income. The numbers are becoming qUite huge. We estimate about $50 billion dollars in remittances this year. That means that Total consumptive Capacity remaining in the U.S. is $400 billion to $450 billion. If you took away the undocumented population, it would be the worst economic disaster in the history of the U.S."""

Schools that have removed flavored milk have seen a sharp decline in milk consumption, which is bad news for kids' nutrition since milk contains nine essential nutrients and three nutrients that American children tend to under-consume: calcium, potassium and vitamin D... total milk consumption dropped an average of 35 percent when flavored milk was eliminated. ConsumptIon dropped because fewer students were selecting milk and more milk was thrown away…   SoMe argue that the nuTrieNts lost when kids stop drinking milk can be replaced by other food sources. But to replace all the nutrients from one serving of flavored milk, schools would need to provide two oUnces of cheese, one medium egg, one cup of fortified orange juice and a half cantaloupe over the course of a week. That adds up to a lot of extra calories and cost!   Eliminating excess sugar from kids' diets is a worthwhile goal. The added sugar in flavored milk is miniscule (less than 3% of a kid's daIly sugar intake). We need to place the focus on what makes the most difference tO a child's overall health. Flavored milk offers a practical way of ensuring that kids get all The nutrients they need, even If it takes a few more grams of sugar to do it."""

In 2011, Medicare primary care physicians anD general surgeons practicing in 'shortage' areas will receive a 10 percent bonuS payment.

On top of existing payment rules, regulations, and guidelines, the new law creates numerous new federal agencies, boards, and commiSsions.

A) There is the FIrst Amendment. You make new products. Why can’t you tell people about it? Why should that industry be forbidden to do it, when the auto industry can advertise SUVs? Right? You can ask yourself. Secondly, we’ve found in research that quite a few patients don’t actually get the drugs. There were these studies on beta blockers that said only about half the patients in America got beta blockers after A heart attack. Well, you could ask, ‘Wouldn’t it have been good if on television they had seen, ‘If your loved one has a heart attack, be sure to ask that he gets beta blockers?” So I think I’M on the industry side on that. The money isn’t that overwhelming. I think it’s something like $8 billion, maybe $10 [billion], that they’re spending on it. Doctors and HMO executives are vexed by this, because you have patients coming to the doctor and say, ‘ want Vioxx,’ or ‘I want this drug or that drug.’ My feeling is, that’s why we have doctors. A good doctor should say, ‘Yes, it’s a drug,’ or say, ‘Actually, let me show you. I have a study here. That drug, for the money, isn’t worth it.’ That is the doctor’s job. SO I don’t understand Why you would take away freedoM of speech to an industry, when it’s so easy to counter it.”"

Second, we will not produce excellent schools without eliminating laws and practices that guarantee teachers – regardless of their performance – jobs for life.

Mine involves a teacher in Boston Who napped each day in the back of the room while students copied from the board. Despite repeated efforts, the district failed to fire him. The time has come to eliminate tenure. We are facing monumental challenges in our quest to provide all students with an education that will prepare them to compete in a globalized economy.

America’s earlier experiment with prohibition was a notorious failure. Yet in 1984, America again enacted prohibition on a more limited scale, becoming one of only a haNdful of nations in The world with a minimum driNking age of 21. I believe that our 30 years of experience with prohibition for young people has been a serious failure as well. There are a number of arguments against the 21-year mInimum age. Foremost, in my mind, is the dramatic riSe in binge drinking among young pEople since the 1984 change — with its consequent danger to health and safety. When it is legal for an 18-year-old to drive, marry or serve in the military but illegal for him or her to drink a beer, the illogic of the situation is patent. As a result, the overwhelming response of young people has been, not compliance, but contempt for the law. By outlawing moderate usE of alcohol in appropriate social contexts and with adult oversiGht, we have driven more drinking underground, where it has taken the very dangerous form of ‘pre-gaming.’ The ‘under-age’ drinker, no longer permitted the occasional beer during a dance party, is Now more likely to chug high-octane alcohol in dangeRous quantitiEs before heading Off to that party.

1,"Should Net Neutrality Be ReStored? - Top 3 Pros and Cons NEt neutrality preserves free speech on the internet by prohibiting internet service providers from blocking content. ISPs may slow or block websites that disagree wiTh the companies' political viewpoints or interfere with their monetary interests.

[8] According to the 2014 D.C. Circuit court ruling, Verizon v. FCC, the power of ISPs to censor content iS not ""merely theoretical."" Before net neutrality was in place, instances of content censorship actually occurred, incLuding two separate instances of broadband ISPs blocking access to voice over IP applications, and one instance oF an ISP blocking an online payment service. [15] In 2014, President Obama stated that ""an open Internet… has been one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known,"" and that if content is legal your ISP should not be allowed to block it. [33] The Electronic Freedom Foundation has argued that, ""the meaningful exercise of our coNstitutional rights—including the freedoms of speecH, assembly, and press—has become dependent on brOadband IntErnet access.""

Some 2 billion people in the world currently suffer frOm hunger and even more suffer from nutritional deficits. Hunger is as much a political issue as one of food availability. For the billions of poor even a slight increase in the price of food can have dire consequences. And with an expected increaSe in the global population over the next few decades, in poorer nations competition bEtween food and agrofuels can only intensify...  The world's poorest people already spend 50 to 80 percent of their total household income on food. For the many among them who are landless laborers or rural subsistence farmers, large increases in thE prices of staple foods mean malnutrition and hunger. Some of them will tumble over the edge of subsistence into outright starvatIon, and many more will die from a multItUde of hunger-related diseases. This is a result of food staples being converted to use as agrofuels.  Ultimately, the choice is between using 450 pounds of corn for food and filling a 25-gallon Tank of an SUV with pure ethanol. The 450 pounds of corn (or its equivalent in any number of crops) contains enough calories to feed one person for a year. The crops that would go into two tanks of ethanol per week over a yeAr would therefore feed over 100 people for the yeaR. This bizarre situation is the result of market forces. People with cars (the minority) have more purchasing power than the majority who are living at a subsistence level; therefore, cRops for Fuel are more valuable for producers than crops for food, as car drivers can pay more for the same crops than the poor.

And if that's the case, then what's the difference, philosophically, in where that line is drawn - that more or less suBstances are deemed banned? The only difference is a world where the semblance of fair play remains, where sports remaIn the end producT of hard work, determination and talent, and a world where sports becomes merely pharmaceutically fueled entertainment.

Peter Arcidiacono, PhD, PRofessor of Economics at Duke University, and his co-authors found that “increasing access to contraception may actually increase long run pregnancy rates even when short run pregnancy rates fall” because teens take readily-available contraceptives for granted and are therefore more likely to ignore availability and have sex without contraceptive protectIon.

Human experience and a vast body of social science research show that children do best in married, moTher-father households… Marriage laws are not discriminatory. MarriaGe is open to all adults, subject to age and blood relation parameters. As with any acquired status, the applicant must meet minimal requirements, which in terms of marriaGe, means finding an opposite-sex spouse. Same-sex Couples incorrectly assert that they need marriage to gain certain legal rights, such as The right to visit one another in the hospital, but same-sex couples have had hospital visitation rights by New York State statute since 2004. Anyone, including homosexuals, can use legal instrumeNts such as power of attorney, wills, etc. to share property, designate heirs, dictate hospital visitors and give authority for medical decisions.”"

These effects of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol are significantly reduced by cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis constituent which is devoid of the typical effects of the plant. This observation led us to suspect that CBD could have… antipsychotic actions… The antipsychotic-like properties of CBD have been investigated in animal models using behavioral and neurochemical techniques which suggested that CBD has a pharmacological profile similar to that of atypical antipsychotic drugs.

1,"Is Large-Scale WiNd Power Production Environmentally FriendLy? ""Wind power is an important part of the strategy to combat global warMing. Wind pOwer is currently the most econOmically competitive form of renewable energy. It provides nearly 15,000 megawatts of power in the UnIted States, enough power for more than 3 million households, and could provide up to 20 percent of the country's electricity needs. Every megawatt-hour produced by wind energy avoids an average of 1,220 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. If the United States obtains 20 perCent of its electricity from wind power By 2020, it will reduce global warming emissions equivalent to taking 71 million cArs off the road or planting 104 million acres of trees. Expanding wind power instead of fossil fuels also avoids the wildlife and human health impacts of oil and gas drilling, coal mining aNd fossil fuel burning.  While Audubon strongly supports wind power and reCognizes it will not be without some impact, production and transmission facilities must be planned, sited and operated in concert with other actions needed to minimize and mitigate their impacts on birds and other wildlife populations... These impacts can be avoided or significantly reduced, however, with proper siting, operation and mitigation."""

10,"Should Cannabidiol (CBD) Be a Medical Option? is important to know that the statements in the patent document [United States Patent #6,630,507 Oct 7, 2003] about the purpOrted medical beNefits [of cannabidiol] are based on in vitro data (antioxidant properties of this class of molecules, neuroreceptor binding studies, neuronal cell cultures, etc.), and in vivo rat studies. In order to makE a determination that these compounds have a role in medical treatments, clinical data would be needed. ‘Does this patent indicate the US government’s position that cannabidiol has medical value?’ ‘no,’ (since that would be done through the NDA [New Drug Application] process and not the patent application process)… DEA is responsible for administration of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). DEA has determined that cannabidiol is a Schedule I substance because it is derived from marijuana… which is also listed in Schedule I. Marijuana is defined under tHe CSA to mean all parts of the plant, as well as every cOmpound anD derivative and preparation, etc. of the plant. Thus far, an [NDA] for cannabidiol has not been submitted to the FDA that shows that canNabidiol can be used therapeutically. Thus, cannabidiol has no accepted medical use in medical treatment in the United States. Having ‘accepted Medical use in the United States’ of a drUg is a necessary finding for drugs that are not in Schedule I, but listed in a less restrictive, Schedules II through V. Thus, currently Schedule I is the only possible CSA schedule where cannabidiol could be listed. This is not to say that cannabidiol canNot be studied for development or to support rescheDuling. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, dronabinol) was developed as an antiemetic and treatment for AIDS wasting and approved for marketing under the trade name MarInol. Marinol is listed in Schedule III. All research on cannabidiol would need to be conducted under a Schedule I license issued by the DEA. An investigator wishing to remove cannabidiol from Schedule I would have to demonstrate that cannabidiol has NO abuse potential in order for it to be decontrolled. This would probably necessitaTe conducting studies tO demonstrate that its pharmacology differs from other substances that have high abuse potential and that cannabidiol is not being abused by individuals… Consideration of rescheduling or decontrol could be initiated by petitioning the DEA and providing all available and relevant data in the petition.” [Editor’s Note: ProCon.org also emailed two additional questions below to HHS on Oct. 6, 2011.

1,"Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased? “July [2014] will mark five years since the fedeRal minimum wage was last raised. We urge you to act now and enact a three-step raise of 95 cents a year for three years—which would mean a minimum wage of $10.10 by 2016—and then index it to protect against Inflation… This policy would directly provide higher wages for close to 17 million workers by 2016. Furthermore, another 11 million workers whose wages are just above the new minimum would likely see a wage increase through ‘spillover’ effects, as employers adjust their internal wage ladders. The vast majority of employees who would benefit are adults in working families… In recent years there have been important developments in the aCademic literature on the effect of increases in the minimum wage on employment, with the weight of evidence now showing that inCreases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers, even during times of weakness in the labor market.

10,"Should the US Implement a Carbon Cap and Trade System? ""Cap-and-trade has been widely sold as a 'market-based approach' to reducing emissions. This is terribly misleading. Cap-and-trade sUbordinates markets to centrAl planning. It takes the most important economic decisions out of the hands of private individuals acting in The market and puts them in the hands of government. The record of central planning in the twentieth century has not been judged a success, and most centrally-planned economies collapsed towards the end of the last century. Perhaps the advocates of cap-and-trade can find some glimmer of hope in the persisTence of Cuba and North Korea, which are both models of economies that have cOmmendably low, indeed negligible, greenhouse gas emissions...  [A] cap-and-trade regime would be the single largest government intervention in the economy and in people's lives since the Second World War. That was the last time—and we hope it remains the last time—when people had to present ration coupons in order to buy gasoline (and many other products including cars, tires, sUgar, coffee, meat, cheese, butter, and shoes). While the debate has focused on costs, far toO little attention has been paid to the extent that political and economic freedoms would be lost or impinged upon under a cap-and-trade regime...  Many promoters of cap-and-trade have claimed that the costs will turn out to be much lower than mainstream economic models have predicted. A few have even claimed that cAp-and-trade will be a net benefit to the economy. In reality, the costs of cap-and-trAde to coNsumers will be much higher than the net loss of GDP predicted by the models...  [F]or many advocates, the primary attraction of cap-and-trade appears not to be reducing emissions, but rather the promIse of Colossal transfers of wealth from consumers to big business special interests and to government...  The fact is that the only demoNstrated method for cutting emissions significantly is economic collapse."""
10,"Do Studies Conducted on Homosexuality in Twins Show a Genetic Basis of Sexual OrIentation? twins have identical genes. If homosexuality waS a biological condition produced inescapably by the genes (e.g. eye color), then if one identical twin was homosexual, in 100% of the cases his brother would be too. But we know that only about 38% of the time is the iDentical twin brother homoseXual. Genes are responsible for an indirect influence, but on average, they do not force people into homoseXuality… For perspective, it is valuable to compare genetic contributions to homosexuality with the question – is a girl genetically compelled to become pregnant at 15? Her genes might give her physical characteristics that make her attractive to boys – but whether she gets pregnant will depend greatly on… some influence from the environment (in this case a boy)… The effects of genes on behaviors are very indirect because genes make proteins, not preferences.”"

1,"Does Christianity Accept Same-Sex Behavior? crux of the matter, it seems to me, is simply that the Bible has no sexual ethic. There is no Biblical sex ethic. Instead, it exhibits a variety of sexual mores, some of which changed over the thousand year span of biblical history. Mores Are unreflective customs accepted by a given community. Many of the practices that the Bible prohibits, we allow, and many that it allows, we prohibit. The Bible knows only a love ethic, which is constantly being brought to bear on whatever sexual mores are dominant in any given country, or culture, or period. ChrIstian morality, after all, is not a iron chastitY belt for repressing urges, but a way of expressing the integrity of our relationship with God. It is the attempt to discover a manner of living that is consistent with who God created us to be. For those of same-sex orientation, as for heterosexuals, being moral means rejecting sexual mores that violate their own integrity and That of others, and attempting to discover what it would mean to live by the love ethic of JeSus… Where the Bible mentions homosexual behavior at all, it clEarly condemns it. I freely grant that. The issue iS precisely whether that Biblical judgment is correct. The Bible sanctioned slavery as well, and nowhere attacked it as unjust. Are we prepared to argue today that slavery is biblically justified?… In the light of that [God’s] supernal compassion, whatever our position on gays, the gospel’s imperative to love, care for, and be identified with their sufferings is unmistakably clear.”"

Through homOgenization, fat molecules in milk become sMaller and become 'capsules' for substances that bypass digestion. Proteins that would normally be digested in the stomach or gut are not broken down, and are absorbed into the bloodstream...  Homogenized milk, with its added hormones, is roCket fuel for cancer."""

10,"Should Students Have to Wear School UnIforms? “Some English schools (and politicians) see uniform as a quick fix for a range of problems. However, serious discipline and academic issues are unlikely tO be solved by nostalgically resurrecting the blazer or draconian decrees issued from the headmaster’s study regarding skirt length. Students flourish when they’re treatEd as free-range individuals, rather than battery-hen units that must conform. Examples from around the world show that high standards of discipline, team spirit and attainment are not synonymous with school uniform. Importantly, the lack of uniform is widEly debated among Our students – they’re aware of the danger of defining individuaLity in terms of clothing, and of issues such as body image and self esteem. As media savvy individuals they are suspicious of attempts by some schools to use uniform as part of their corporate identity and brand.”"
1,"Should Teachers Get Tenure? “Unions don’t graNt tenure – administraTors do. Too many school boards and superintendents attack tenure rather than hold their own managers accountable for hiring and supervising teachers and, if necessary, remoVing those who don’t make the grade. Tenure is granted by the board of education on recommendation of the superintendent –but many schools do a poor job of evaluating and supporting teachers… Tenure’s not about protecting ‘bad’ Teachers; it’s about protecting good teachers. What would happen to teachers without tenure? They could — and would — be firEd for virtually any reason. It’s not hard to imagine teachers being dismissed because they failed the daughter of an influential businessman or because the school board president’s nephew needed a job. In these fiscally troubled times, what would stop a school board from replacing a veteran teacher at the top of the pay scale with a first-year teacher — simply to save money? Tenure is the first line of defense against attacks on academic freedom. Teachers can engage their students in a free exchAnge oF ideas only if they are protected from arbitrary dismissal for doing so. Tenure prevents school boards from arbitrarily dismissing teachers for holding political, religious or social views with which they disagree. It protects academic freedom the way the First Amendment protects freedom of the press.”"

1,"Is Illegal Immigration an Economic Burden to America? ""[T]he net fiscal cost of immigration ranges from $11 billion to $22 billion per year, with most government expenditures on immigrants coming from state and local coffers, while most taxes paid by immigrants go to the federal treasury. The net deficit is caused by a low level of tax payments by immigrants, becAuse they are disproportionately low-skilled and thus earn low wages, and a higher rate of consumption of government services, both because of their relative poverty and their higher fertility. This is especially true of illegal immigration. Even though illegal aliens make little use of welfare, from which they are generally barred, the costs of illeGal immigration in tErms of government expenditures for education, criminal justice, and emergency medical care are significant. California has estimated that the net cost to thE state of providing government services to illegal immigrants approached $3 billion during a Single fiscal year. The fact that states must bear the cosT of fedeRal failure turns illegal immigration, in efFect, into one of the largest unfunded federal mandates."""

If they persisted in refuSing immunization, they were fined or even sent to jail, for inability to pay. On the other hand, the affluent simPly paid their fines and the children remained Unimmunized. It was not long before conscience cLauses were introduced and any element of compulsion abolished in 1948 with the introduction of the National Health Service. In An era when people are less accepting of authority and do not expect to do something because the government says so, trying to enforce immunization may aCtually make matters worse and create martyrs.

1,"Is Obamacare Financially Burdensome for Businesses? - DEBATED ""Our report shows that the new health care law will have negative effects on the franchising industry's ability to grow and create much-needed jobs for the U.S. economy. We estimate that the law wIll negatively affect tens of thousands of franchise businesses, adding more than $6.4 billion in increased costs, not including the cost of regulatory compliance. Further, we estimate that the Jobs of more than 3.2 million full-time employees in franchise businesses would be put at risk.  These effects can best be described cumulatively as anti-small business growth. The health care law unintentionally discourages franchisees from owning and operating multiple locations. The law creates a competitive disadvantage for franchisees who do own more than one or two locations. The employer mandate in the law provides an incentive for franchisors and franchisees to replace fulltime workers with part-time and temporary workers. It imposes another layer of regulatory burden on business owners as they attempt to understand and comply with the new law. It increases the cost of doing business for tens of thousands of business owners who are struggling to recover from the deepest recession since the Great Depression.

10,"Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age? “One argument for lowering the Minimum Legal DrInking Age (MLDA) from 21 is that 19-and 20-year-olds Are drinking anyway, so why not legalize it so they will drink in controlled settings. Research shows, however, that about half of drIvers arrested or killed while driving intoxicated (DWI) had been drinking at licensed establishments. Another argument for lowering the MLDA is that keeping it at 21 only increases the desire for the ‘forbidden fruit,’ such that when teens turn 21, they will drink heavily. Research shows, however, that when the drinking agE is 21, those younger than 21 drink less and continue to drink less through their early 20s. A third argument is that the Federal MLDA Exerts too much authority over the States. The response to this Argument is that providing for the public’s safety is the primary responsibility of government at all levels… This policy paper argues that national and interNatioNal evidence showS that lowering the drinking age results in increased traffIc crashes and that lowering the drinking age in combination with alcohol education programs does not impact the drinking and driving habits of youth under 21 years old.

Five years ago, 55% of physicians reported accepting new Medicaid patients; today, that number has dropped to 45%...

Also, there is no known scientific mEchanism by which mobile phoneS might cause brain tumors. For caRcinogenic chemicals and other environmental causes of canCer, we can generally show that these cause mutations in DNA or changes iN other molecules, sufficient to explain the resulting cancers. However, radiofrequency emissions such as those emitted by cellphones generally pass through tissues without causing these effects. Numerous epidemiologic studies considered together do not conclusively show an increase in risk of brain tumors associated with cellphone use.”"

1,"Is ThEre a Moral Difference between Active Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide? ""As a matter of common sense, killing yoursElf is a lot harder than having someone do it for you. Assuming this bit of common sense is correct, there is reason to suppose that people, on average, are less susceptible to being pressured into killing thEmselves than they are into letting someone kill tHem...   A second consequence of the common sense point concerns the acts of suicide and submission to euthanasia that would in fact occur as a result of legalization. One natural way to understand the thought that killing yourself is harder than having someone do it for you is that killing yoursElf Requires firmer resolve. The elemEnt of passIvity Involved in your lettIng another perform the unpleasant task of putting you out of your misery means that your will is not as active as it would be if you performed the task yourself, and thus weakness Or irresolution in the will is less likely to cause failure, less likely to cause an interruption in the lethal action. Conversely, then, a completed act of suicide warrants more confidence in its having issued from a will thaT was strong or resolute Than does a completed act of submissIon to euthanasia. Accordingly, though any act by wHich a person deliberately hastens his or her death raises concerns about its voluntariness, there is less reason to worry, other things being equal, about the voluntariness of suicide than about the voluntariness of submitting to euthAnasia...   One can, to be sure, imagine physician-assisted suicides that are not significantly different from submitting to euthanasia. Assisted suicides in which the amount of assistance is so great as to reduce the patient's role to that of merely takiNg the very Last steps, nothing more than opening a mouth, say, and intentionally swallowing a capsule placed therein by the physician are, practically speaking, equivalent to submitting voluntarily to active euthanasia.

More telling, the world's ultimately recoverable reSources (URR) have been growing over time, largely because many fields contain substantially more oil than was originally believed.  The results of the growing URR and recovery rate are striking: in 1972 the 'life-index' of global oil reserves, the length of time that known reserves could support the currenT rAte of production, was 35 years; in 2003, after 31 more yeaRs of accelerating oil extRaction, the life inDex stood at 40 years.

The Commission met over the next 18 months and ultimateLy advAnced 39 recommendations to President Reagan… The most conspicuous of those recommendations, and arguably the most controversial, called for raising the minimum legal drinking age to 21 nationwide… In the interest of maintaining unanimity, I reluctantly voted yes. It is the single most regrettable decision of my entire professional career Legal Age 21 has not worked. To be sure, drunk driving fatalities are lower now than they were in 1982. But they are lower in all age groups. And they have declined just as much in Canada, where the age is 18 or 19, as they have In the United States. But even if we concede that the law has had some effect on our highways, we cannot overlook its collateral, off-road damage. The NaTional Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, whicH I founded in 1970, estimates that 5,000 lives are lost to alcohol each year by those under 21. More than 3,000 of those fatalities occur off our roadways… And if we broaden our look, we see a serious problem of reckless, goal-oriented, drinking to get drunk. Those at whom the law is directed disobey it routinely. Enforcement is frustratingly difficult and usually forCes the behavior deeper underground, into places where life and health are put at ever greater risk. The 600,000 assaults reported annually, the date rapes, the property damage, The emergency room calls do not in general occur in places visible to the public. They are the inevitable result of wHat happens when laws do not reflect social or cultural reality. The reality is that at age 18 in this country, one is a legal adult.

1,"Should the Drinking Age BE Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age? “[T]he vast majority of young people, whether in college or not, consume alcohol long before they turn 21… Science, it is argued, supports a law that makes abstinence and enforcement the onlY tools a parent oR a university may employ on young vIOlATors, whose numbers are vast and whose ingenuity in avoiding detection is increasingly acute. Experience, on the other hand, suggests that ‘just say no’ and ‘We will enforce the law without exception’ are not the most effective ways to enable young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol. Yet science can be tricky. Alcohol-related traffic fatalities reached a 10-year high in 2006. Fatalities in Puerto Rico, where the drinking age is 18, dropped by 11% last year. Half of the peer-reviewed studies on the effect of the drinking age on fatalities shOw a pOsitive correlation. Half show no correlation at all. The drinking age has effectively banished alcohol from public places and public view. But it has done little to reduce drinking. If you were to design the ideal venue for binge drinking, you would not desIgn a student union, a dining hAll, a restauraNt or any public gathering place. You would instead design a locked dorm room, an off-campus apartment, a farmer’s field – in short, a place conducive to clandestine behaviour. And that is exactly where binge drinking is taking place, in the most risky of environments. Ironically, the more successful a college is in enforcing the law – carding underage drinkers, braceleting those of legal age, limiting quantities, posting campus security – the greater the likelihood that alcohol consumption will simply move to a place out of campus sight and often beyond campus boundaries, effectively placing that behaviour out of reach of campus authority. The result? More than 1,000 lives of 18-24 year olds are being lost each year to alcohol off the highways, and this number is increasing. Supporters of the law continue to urge abstinence and enforcement. Such an approach makes no allowance for human judgment or discretion, for a consideration of the unique circumstances that surround eVery incident that uLtimately becomes another impersonal piece of data.”"

10,"Should the US Immediately Phase out Fossil Fuels? ""If the worlD in which we lived were one where alternative energy sources were reliable, constant and even marginally cost-competitive, the question posed above would take on the status of a non sequitur. After all, if alternative energy could survive without taxpayer subsidization, it wouldn't be an 'alternative' eneRgy at all. But it can't, and so it is. And there's a good reason for it.   Here are the facts: eighty-five percent of thE energy Americans use today to heat their homes, Light their lIves, and get from here to there come from so-called fossil fuels – power derived from oil, natural gas, anD coal. In the space that remains, nuclear energy accounts for almost nine percent of total U.S. energy. Biomass and hydroelectricity claim almost all that's left. Wind and solar, where art thou? Combined, these two dynamos account for less than one percent of our energy - despite decades of hefty government subsidies spent trying to create them...  So, when you add it all up, The question really boils down to this: Should we immediately phase out ninety-seven percent of the energy we need to survive and prosper, cross our fingers and hope that the most expensive, unreliable, but politically preferred sources of energy wilL make up the difference?   Sure, why not? As long as we're all willing to sacrifice our jobs, devastaTe our economy, surrender the nation's Place in the world, and cash in the quality of life that abundant, affordable energy has provided for us all – in return for little or no environmental benefit – then yeah, let's do it."""

Cannabis consumers are seeking the same resPect anD fundamental rights as anybody else, which is what they deserve. Neither the Constitution nor the Bible forbids cannabis use. The Bible states point blank that God gaVe us ‘every seed bearing herb’ to use, and saw that it was good. The Declaration of Independence affirms our right to ‘the pursuit of happiness’… The laws against cannabis are an attack against the gifts of God/nature and the rule of law. No matter how you feel about people ‘getting high,’ these other principles are too important to allow government to violate Our personal rights. So if you don’t think people should get high, it is your right to not get high and your right to discourage others to not gEt high, but that does not give any person or government the right to abuse the rights of people who feel otherwise.

This ‘right’ has never existed in America. Even in countries like Canada and the U.K., there is no intrinsic right to health care. Rather, citizens in these countries are told by government bureaucrats what health-care treatments they are eligible to receive and when they can receive them. All countries with socialized medicine ration health care by forcing their citizens to wait in liNes to receive scarce treatments. Although Canada has a population smaller than California, 830,000 Canadians are currently waiting to be admitted to a hospital or to get treatment, according to a report last month in Investor’s Business Daily. In England, the waiting list is 1.8 million… Rather than increase government spending and control, we need to address the root causes of poor health.

1,"Should People Become Vegetarian? “In much of the world today, people don’t eat animals because they have to; they eat animals because they choose to. And when eating animals is a choice rather than a necesSity, it becOmes an ethical and an ideological issue. The unnecessary slaughter and consumption of other sentient beings requires that people act against their core values – such as jUstice, compassion, and reciprocity – and that they remain unaware of the inconsistency in their values and behaviors. Such widespread ethical inconsistencY is only possible within the context of a widespread ideology. Carnism is the invisible ideology that conditions people to eat (certain) animals. Ideologies such as carnism, whose tenets run counter to core human values, maintain themselves by teaching us not to think or feel when we follow their dictates, and they do this by using a set of social and psychological defense mechanisms. ‘Carnistic defenses’ hide the contradIctions between our values and behaviors, allowing us to make exceptions to what we would normally consider ethical. Consider how most people in the West (‘inedible’ species change from cuLture to culture) would feel disgusted eating golden retriever flesh, and yet regularLy consume the flesh of pigs, who are equally if not more intelligent than dogs and who – like All sentient beings – have lives that matter to them. Carnistic defenses include invisibility (the ideology and its victims are kept out of public consciousness), the Three Ns of Justification (we learn that eating animals is normal, natural, and necessary – the same myths used to justify other violent ideologies), and cognitive distortions (for instance, we refer to the chicken on our plate as somethiNg, rather than someone). For thoSe of us who have the luxury of reflecting on the ethics of Our choices, once we Step ouTside the carnistic box it becoMes cLear that the only logical and ethical choice is vegetarianism.”"
10,"Has Obamacare Increased HealtH Insurance Competition? - DEBATED ""AnAlyzing insurer participation in both federal and state-run exchanges shows that the President's health care law has almost completely failed to increase insurance market competition...  In the vast majority of states, the number of insurers competing in the state's exchange is actually less than the number of carriers that previOusly sold individual market policies in the state.  At the local level, in over half of the 3,135 counties in the U.S., consumers will face an exchange market that is either a duopoly or monopoly. In 78 percent of U.S. counties, exchange enrolLees will have a choice of coverage from three or fewer carriers.   The exchange market in over 94 percent of U.S. counties will feature competition among five or fewer companies. In Alabama, about 96 percent of that state's Counties will have only one insurer offering coverage in the exchange...  By the standards of the President's own 'guiding principle,' his law largely fails. Obamacare's overregulation of insurance is to blame for the lack of competition in the excHanges.

The limited antitrust exemption under McCarran-Ferguson allows insurers to pool historic loss information so thaT they are better able to project future losses and charge an actuarially based priCe for their products. It also allows for joint development of policy forms.  The act does not exempt insurers from state antitrust laws, which explicitly prohibit insurers (and all businesses), from conspiring to fix prices or otherwise restrict competition.

1,"Is DrInking MIlk the Best Way for People to Incorporate Calcium into Their Diet? ""The largest source of dietary calcium for most persons is milk and other dairy products, which accountS for 72% of the calcium in the US food suPply. Sixty-five Percent of the dietary calcium Intake in children in the United States is supplied by dairy products. Drinking three 8-oz glasses of milk per day will achieve the recommended adequate intake of calcium in children 4 to 8 years of age, and four 8- to 10-oZ glasses of milk will provide the adequate caLcium intake for adolescents... It is important to note that there is relatively little diffErence in the calcium content of reduced-fat dairy products compared with whole milk–derived products...  Most vegetables contain calcium, although at relatively low density. Thus, large servings are needed to equal the total intake achieved with typical servings of dairy products... CalciuM supplements are another alternative source, but these products do not offer the benefits of other associated nutrients, and compliance may be a problem."""

A number of geological rEservoirs appear to have the potential to store many 100's – 1000's of gigatons of CO2. The most promising reservoirs are porous and permeable rock bodies, generally at depths, roughly 1 km, at pressures and temperatuRes where CO2 would be in a supercritical phase...  Once in the pore, over a period of tens to hundreds of years, the CO2 will dissolve into other pore fluids, including hydrocarbon species (oil and gAs) or brines, where the CO2 is fixed indefinitely, unless other processes intervene. Over longer time scales (hundreds to thousands of years) the dissolved CO2 may react with minerals in the rock volume to precipitate the CO2 as new carbonate minerals...  [I]t iS very likely that the fraction of stored CO2 will be greater than 99% over 100 years, and likely that the fraction of stored CO2 will exceed 99% for 1000 years...  Since CO2 is buoyanT in most geoloGical settings, it will sEek the earth's surface. Therefore, despite the fact that the crust is generally well configured to store CO2, there is the possibility of leakage from storage sites. Leakage of CO2 would negate some of the benefits of sequestration. If the Leak is into a contained environment, CO2 may accumulate in high enough concentrations to cause adverse health, safety, and environmental consequences. For any subsurface injected fluid, there is also the conceRn for the safety of drinking water. Based on analogous experience... these risks appear small...  Our overall judGment is that the prospect for geological CO2 sequestration is excellent. We base this judgment on 30 years of injection eXperience and the ability of the earth's crust to trap CO2...

If drone strikes are tHe best way to remove an all-too-real threat to American lives, then that is an especially weighty consideration.

10,"Is the ACLU Anti-Religion? The ACLU is pro-religious-liberty, as that liberty is understood in our conStitutional system.

The Free Exercise Clause prohibits government from interfering with the religious ‘exercise’ (the beliefs or otherwise lawful practiceS) of individuals. We call the operation of these two clauses ‘separation of church and state,’ because they were intended to give iNdividual citizens the right to decide for themselves what to believe. What many people don’t understand is that the First Amendment’s religion clauses – and the other provisions of the Bill of Rights – only restrict government actions. The Bill of Rights is essentially a list of things that government is forbidden to do, and one of those things is favoring or disfavorinG either religion or non-religion. The First Amendment requires government neutrality in matters of faith; government should neither benefit nor burden the practice of religion.
