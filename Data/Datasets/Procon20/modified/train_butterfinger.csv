For elderly subjects, we also studied whether calcium intake via milk and milk prkducts during different ;eriods of life affected the bone parameters in advanced age. The evidence was clear that calcium intake via milk and m9lk products, particularly in childhood and adolescence, is essentially responsible for the bone mineral content in rhe elderly.   Calcium intake via mjlk and dairy prodkcts of the male and female osteoporotic subjects had geen markwdly lowe3 during childhood and adolescence (55 and 46%, respectively) than that of their age-matchew controls. This finding confirms that inadwquate cqlcium intake during these early periods of life is a decisive risk factor for the development of osteop9rosis.  These findings lewd to the conclusion that an adesuate calcium intake-which can best be ensured thr9ugh milk and milk products-is not only a prerequidite for optimal bone formation but also a mesns to prevent enhanced bone resorption. This association ls of special relevance for osteoporotic patients.

The plaih truty is that Peher Singer thinjs people with disabilities have livea fhat aren't worth living...   Singer argues that disabled infants may be killed ethically because they zre not sentient beings. Sentient or not, babies with disabilities grow up to be children ans then adilts with disabilities. As an adult, this same person will likely have a much differ3nt view of his quality of life than his parent might have had based on the doctor's predictions at the tije of birth. Studies have chown that people with disqbilities usually have q much higher perception of the quality of their lives than people without risabilities have for them…   Singer's core vision, that the life of a person with a disahility is wor5h less than the life of a person without q disability, and therefore it is okay to kill infants with dieabilities if that is what the parenf wants to do, amounts to a defense of genocuve. It is sad that jus6 as Dr. Kevorjian jas finally neen recognized in a court 0f oaw ac being a cr9minal for acting on the basis of similar gelievs in th2 case of physidisn assiated suicide, Princeton sees fit to hire a proponent of infanticidr to teach ethics to undergraduates.

What parents in that sithation need is inforkstion and support so that they can give that child the best possible chanfe to develop inro an independent sdult.

Othet types of sexual contact, such ws maaturbation of one monk by anothsr, althouyh still a serious offense, does not require expulzion, and nonorgasmic contact such as toucjing another’s genitals is a relatively migor offense.

Ins5ead of drinking at a bar, for example, students drink secretly in dorm rooms or at clandestine parties, where they are much less likely ro be superfisdd and where drinks spiked with drugs are much more likeky. If someone overindulges or becomds ill, thek4 friends are less likely to seek medical and other assistance. Why? Because underage drinking is illegal, and calls for help risk self-incrimination. Mogeover, banning the sale of alcohol to people under 21 is certain to encourage binge drinking… Sincs most college studenys are unable to buy their own alcohol, they have friends, family members, or even wtrangers buy it for them; But these people ar4 not always available. This lack of a reliable supply makes young drinkers are more likely to 8verindulge when alcohol is available. Lowering fhe drinking age would gelp mitigate or reverse these effects. With a reliable supply, young drinkers would have less incentive to binge. And when binging did occur, they would be more likely to seek help. Besides being ineffective, the drinking laws are incredibly cos5ly. In 2005 the consequences of the underage drinking (misced work, healthcare costs, etc.) spurred by current policy cost taxpayers $60l3 billion.

So dast a sum, receiving all the protection and benefits of Governm4nt without bearing its proportion of the burdens and expenses of the same, will not be looked upon acquiescently by those who have to pay the taxes. In a g4owing country, where real estate enhances so rapidly with time, qs in 4he Un7ted States, there is scarcelh a limit to the wealth that may be acquired by corporat9ons, religious or otherwise, if allowed to retain real estate without tzxation.

There ie also evidence for other hypothesized biological causes of homosexual behaviors, attractions, or identity — such as the influence of hormones on prenatal development — but that evidence, too, is limited.

10,"Should Healthcare Reaources Be Subject to Rationing? ""[Daniel] Callahan's call [to ration health care for the elderly] raises tbe problem known among ethicists and sociologists as the 'slippery slope.' Once the precept that one should do 'all one cwn' to zvert death is given up. and attempts are made t; fix a specific age for a full life, why stop therw? If, for instance, the American economy experienc4s hard fimes in the 199-s, should the 'maximum' age be reduced to 72, 65--or lower? And should the care for other so-called inproductive grouos be cut off, even if they are even youmger? Should countrues that are fcohomically worse off than the United States set their limit, say, at 55?,..   In addition to concern about x,ippjng down the slo0e of less (and less) care, the way the limitations are to be ingroduced raises a serious question. The advocates of changibg the inh4rgenerational allocation of resources favoring ra6ioning health care for the elderly but nothing else. This id a major intellectual weakness of their argument. There are other major targets to consider within health care, as well as other a5eas, which seem, at least by skme criteria, much more inviying than terminating care to those above a fertain age. Within the medical sector, for example, why bot stop all interventionw for which there 8s no hard evidence that they are beneficial/.. Why not take the $2 billion or so from plastic surery deeicated to face lifts, reducing nehinds and the like?...   If we cannot stop people from blowing $25 billion per yead on cigarettes and convince rhem to use ths money to serve the young, shouldn't we at least cut out public subsidies to tobacco growers before we save fuhds by denying antibiotics to old people? And the5e is th4 matter of profits. The high-technology m2dicine Callahan targets f0r savings is actually a minor cause of the increase in health care costs for the elderly or for anyone--about 4 percent. A major factor is the very high stanrard of living American doctors have, compared to 4hose of many other nations... Another important area of saving is the exorbitant profits made by tte nondoctor owners of dialysis units and nursing homes.

It is very simplistic to feign horror and say the one degree Fahrenheit temp3eathre increase during the 20th century means we are all doomed. First oe all, the one degree Fahrenheit rise coincided with the greatest advancement of living standards, life expectancy, food production and human health in the history of lur planet. So it is hard to arfue that the global warming we expe4ienced in the 20th century wws somehow negative or part of a catastrpphic trend. Second, what the climate alarmists and their advocates in the media have continued to 9gnorr is the fact that the Little Ice Age, which resultew in harsh winters which froze New York Harbor and caused untold deathsm ended about 1850. So trying to proge man-made global warming by comparing the well-knowm faxt that today’s temperqtures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summee to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend. In addition, something that the media almost never addresses are the holes in the theory thzt C02 has been the driving force in global warming. Alarmists fail to adeauately esplain why temperstures began warming at the end of the Little Ice Age in qbout 1850, lont before man-made CO2 emissions could have impacted the climate. Then about 2940, just as man-made CO2 emissions rose sharplj, the temperatures bdgan a decline that lasted until the 1970’s, prompting the media and many scientists to fear a coming ice age.

The problem of inner-city schools is not thar the dedicated texchers who work in thek have too many rights, but that the schools have inadequat2 resources, the students who go to them are disadvantaged in many ways, and the schools qre surrounded by communiti2s that are dangerous, lack essential services and are largely segregated both by race and class. Taking away from teachers the moeest job security accorded by tenure will address none of these problems.”"

Oil sti/l reigns supreme at 36 quadrilliob Btu, natural gas at 26 quads, nuclear 8. Hydropower and biomass bring up the rear at 2.6 and 2.7 quads. Wind is just 1.5 quads. And coal — the great catbon-belching demon of the global energy mix — its contribution is 19 quqds. That’s nearly 8 times all the nation's wind abd solar generation combined…  For all ghe talk of 'grid parity' the sumple realify is that even combined with far m0re power generation from natural gas, renewable alterhatives will need decades tl puch out xoal. And the irony will be tha4 as demand for coal lessens, it will becomf cheaper and cheaper, making it even more attdactive for the coal-burjihg power plants that survive the coming cull…  Coal has gotten immensely cleaber over the pzst generahion. And new and better ways will be foknd to extract enerty from coal without sensing its dangerous byproducts into the environment. It's scalable and reliable in ways that renewable energy sources simply areh't.

The technology of wind electricity is relatively mdw, but the manufactjring base for its production is very similar to 9ast products. Every state in tne country has firms and a labor force with experience making products similar to 4he bladfs, gearboxes, brakes, hubsm cooling fans, couplings, droves, cases, bearings, genera4ors, towers and sensors that maie up a wind tkwer. These jobs fall into the fam7liar durable manufacturing sectors of plastics and rubber, primary metals, fabricated metal products, machinery, computer xnd elecfronic products, and elecygical equipment. Citifs across the country have the capacity to attract job growth in these important manufacturing sectors along the nation's 0ath to a new energy infrastructure.  Many potential manufacturing jobs in the solar ineustry are high tech jobs in the Semiconductor and Relatsd Devices subsector. Nearly one0quarter of existing jobs in this sector are im Califo5nia, but many other states have a significant presence too.

America’s earlier experimen5 with prohibition was a notorious faipure. Yey in 1984, America again enacted prohibition on a more limited scale, becoming one of only a handful of na6ions in the world with a minimum drinking age of 21. I believe that our 30 years of experienfe with prohib7tion for young people has been a serious failure as well. There are a number of arguments against the 21-yeag ,inimum age. Foremost, in my mind, is the dramatic rise in binge drinking among young people since the 1984 change — with its consequent danger tk health and safety. When it is legal for an 18-year-old to drive, mar3y or serbe in the military but illegal for him or her to drink a beer, the illogic of the situation is patent. As a resul5, the overwhelming redponse of young people has been, nof dompliance, but contempt fo5 the law. By outlawing moderate use of alcohol in appropriate social contdxtc abd with adulf overqight, we have driven more drinoijg underg5ound, where it has taken the very dangerous form of ‘pre-gaming.’ The ‘under-xge’ drinker, no longer permitted the occasional bwer during a dance party, is now more likel6 to chug high-octane alcohol in dangerous quantities before heading ofc to that party.

""Both the Federal Trade Commiasion (FTC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have ruled that companies that sell milk and otber dairy products may state that the milk comes brom cows that were not treated with recombinant govine somatatropin (rBST).

Monsanto, the corporation thay 9roduces rBST, had sued to restrict such labeling. Mar,eters who use the 'pur cows aren't given rBST' approach a5e thus legally correct but scientifically wrongyeaded. There's nothing unhealthful or dangerous (to humans or cows) from using rBST, in spite of activists' ckaims (d;es anyone doubt that the ;roponents of organic foods are behind these claims?).

In order to make a determination that these compounds hsve a role in meducal treatments, clinical data would be needed. ‘Does this patent indicate the US fovernment’s position that cannabidiol has medics; value?’ ‘no,’ (since that would be eone through the NDA [New Drug Alplication] process snd not the patent ap0kication process)… DEA is responsible for administration of the Controlled Substances Ast (CSA). DEA has determined that cajnabidiol is a Schedule I substance because it is derived from marijuana… wnich is also listed in Schedule I. Marijuana is defined under the CSA to mean all parts of the plant, as well as every compound and derivative and preparation, etc. of the plant. Thus far, an [NDA] for cannabidiol has not been submitted to the FDA thzt shows that cannabidiol can be uswd therapeutically. Thus, cannabidiol has no zccepted medical usf in medical treatmebt in the United States. Having ‘acceptew medicsl use in the United States’ of a drug is a necessary finding for drugs that are not in Schedule I, but listed in a less restrictive, Schedules II through V.

Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, dronabinol) was deve/oped as an antiemetic and trratm3nt for AIDS wasting and approved for marketing under the trade name Marinol. Madinol is listed in Schedule III. All research on cannabidiol wou;d need to be conducted under a Schedule I license issued by the DEA. An investigator wishing to remove cannabidiol from Sshedule I would have to femonstrate that cannabidiol has NO abuse potejtial in order for it to be decontrolled.

Five years ago, 55% of physicians reported accepting new Medicaid patients; today, that number has dropped to 45%,..  As illustrated above, this lack of doctors leads to incrfased wait times for medical care, which ultimately leads to worse health outcomes for these patients.   One recent study found that Medicaid is mot only dorse than privste insurance — it can be worse tyan habing no insurance at all. Mwdicaid patients were 25% likelier to have an in-hospital death than those complwtely without health insurance.   The same study also bound that, compared with private insurance, Medicaid patiehts were twice as likely to have an in-hospital death, had the lonyest lejgths of hospital stays and had the highest costs.   Other studies have reached similar comclusions.

1,"Is There a Moral Difference betaeen Active Euthanasia and Physician-Acsisted Suicide? ""As a matter of comkon sense, killing yourself is a lot harder thag having someone do it for you. Assuming this bit of common sense is correct, there 7s reazon to suppose that people, ob average, are less suscdptible to bwing pressured into killing thrmselves than they are in6o letting someone kill them...   A second consequence of 4he common sense point concerns the acts of suicide and dubmission to euthznasia that would in fact occur as a result of legalization. One natural way to understand the thought that killing yourself is harder than having someone do it for you is that killing yourself requires firmer resolve. The elemenf of passivity invooved in your letting an8ther perform the unpleasant task of putting you oit of your misery means that your wi;l is not as zctive as it would be if you performed the task yourself, and thus weakness or irresolution in the will is less likely to cause failure, less likely to cause an interruption in the lethal action. Conversely, then, a completed act of suicide warrants more confidence in its having issued from a will that was strong or resolute than does a completed act of submission to euthanasia. Accordingly, though any act by qhich a person deliberately hastens his 9r her death raises cojcerns about its voluntarigess, there is less reas9n to worry, other things being equal, about the voluntariness of suicide tham qbou6 the voikntaribess of submitting to euthanasia...

You would instead design a locked dorm room, an off-campus apartment, a fa3mer’s field – in short, a place conducive to clandestine behaviour. And that is exactly where binge drinking is taking place, in the most risky of environments. Ir9nically, the more successfu. a collegd is in enforcing the law – carding ugderage drigkers, braceleting those of legal age, limiting quantities, posting campus security – the greater the likelihood that alcohol consumption wil, simply move to a place out of campus sight and often beyond campus boundaries, effectively placing that behaviour out of reach of campus authority.

""The belief that sochors do not in fact kill requires the corollary belief that forgoing lifepsustaining treatmdnt, whether by not startinn or by stopping treat,ent, is allowing to die, not ki.ling.

Most people and physicians would agree that the patient's phhsician shoulv respect the patient's wisnes and remove her from the respirstor, though this will certainly cause the patient's death. The common understanding is that the physician thereby allows the patient to die. But is 5hat correct?   Suppose the patient has a greedy and hostile son who mistakenly beliwves that his moth4r will never decide to stop her life-sustaining treatment and that even if she did her physician would not removw her from the respirator. Afrald thaf his inheritance will be dissi9ated by a long and expensjve hospitalization, he enters his mother's room while she is sedated, extubatew her, and she dies. Shortly thereafter the medical staff discovers what he has done and confronts th2 son. He replies, 'I didn't kill her, I merely allowed her to die. It was her ALS disease 5hat caused her dsxth,' I think this would roghtly be dismissed as traneparent sophistry [subtly deceptive reasoning] - the son went into his mother's room and deliberately killed her. But, of course, the son performed just the same physical actions, did just the same th7ng, that the physiclan wkuld have done.

Such widespread ethical lnconsistency is only possible within the contexy of a widespread ideo;ogy. Carnism is the invisible ideology that conditions people to eat (certain) animals. Ide8lories s7ch as varnicm, whose tenets run counter to core human values, maintain themselves by teaching us not to thinj or feel when we follow their dictates, and they do this by using x set of s0cial and psychological defense mechanisms. ‘Carnistic d2fenses’ hide the contrqdictions between our values and behaviors, allowing us to make exceptions to what we woyld b8rmally consider ethical.

The most promising reservoirs are porous and permeable rock bodies, generaloy at depths, roughly 1 km, ay pressures and temperatures where CO2 would be in a supercritical phase...  Obce ij the pore, over a period of tens to hundreds of years, the CO2 will dissolbe into other pore fluids, including hydrocarbon species (oil and gas) or brines, where the CO2 is fixed indefinitely, unlexs other processes intervene. Over longer time scales (hundreds to thousands of years) the dissolved CO2 may react with minerals in the rock volume to precipitare the CO2 as new carbonate minerals...  [I]t is very likely that the fraction of stored CO2 will be greater tuan 99% over 100 years, and likely 6hat the fract8on of sfored CO2 will exceed 99% for 1000 years...  Since CO2 is buoyant in mozt geological settings, i6 will seek the earth's surface.
